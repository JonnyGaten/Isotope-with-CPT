# Isotope-with-CPT
Using isotope.JS with WP CPT

# How to setup
* First, create a CPT. In this example, we will use vacancies.
* Next, create some taxonomies to filter by. In this, we will use country and department.

* Make sure you have jQuery on your page
* Once we have our post setup, we need to include isotope, we can do this via a CDN:

```
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="//npmcdn.com/isotope-layout@3/dist/isotope.pkgd.js"></script>
```

* Next, we will include some styling for isotope. Use the .css file supplied to add the nessessary styling.
* After we have our CSS and CDN, lets add the JS. Use the .JS file supplied to add the nessessary JS.
* Add the PHP to your page template.

## Note
* All of the code supplied is commented and easy to understand. You can head to https://isotope.metafizzy.co/
